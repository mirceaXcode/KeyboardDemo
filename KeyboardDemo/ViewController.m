// I had to do uncheck Use Safe Area Layout Guides in order to get the Bottom and Top Layout. You don't have them by default in iOS 11 anymore.
// All you need to do is open the storyboard in IB, make sure the Utilities panel is open, then select the File Inspector tab. If you look in the Interface Builder Document section of the panel you'll see a new checkbox: Use Safe Area Layout Guides.
